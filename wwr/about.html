            <p>Founded in 2005 by a group of local river guides, White Water Rafting Company began as a small weekend
                operation. Over the years we've grown into a full-service outfitter while keeping a strong commitment to
                conservation, community partnerships, and outdoor education. Our mission is to share the river while
                protecting it for future generations.</p>
